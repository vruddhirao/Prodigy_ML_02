# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

# Overview
This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python on Kaggle.

# Dataset
The dataset includes customer purchase history with features such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the store based on customer spending behavior and loyalty.

# Steps to perform

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Selecting the relevant features for the model.
Model Training: Training the K-means clustering model on the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like the Elbow method and Silhouette score.
